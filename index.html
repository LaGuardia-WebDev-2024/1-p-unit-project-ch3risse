      ..and I met by association, via a close friend. and, she's an amazing
      singer. i can really trust her when i'm feeling down, and she draws really
      well! i'm really happy that i got over my social anxiety, and became
      friends with such an amazing person. also, she's <i>little red!</i> that's
      gotta be a flex, in its own right.

      i met leila in sophomore year, in weight training! i did a couple of
      things in order to become her friend:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style="color: #552b74">i invited her to my sweet 16..</li>
    <li style="color: #552b74">
      i continuously talked to her, while failing to work out.
    </li>
    <li style="color: #552b74">
      ..and i tried to speak to her through another friend that had weight
      training with us. she was a little shy. ;3
    </li>
    
    </ul>
    
    <p style="color: #552b74">
      she's really great! and a lot of our interests align. i like reading
      fanfiction, she does too! i like manga, she does too! and a lot more
      stuff. i'm really happy that we've become friends when we did. it's really
      nice to have a friend who's like me, despite all of the "opposites attact"
      stuff.

      we met each other in freshman year, in our english class with mrs. vivar.
      it's like the tecachers in freshman and sophomore year knew we werent a
      good duo when it came to class staying silent, so our schedules didn;t
      align to much after that. nevertheless, we're glued by the hip. we
      survived a lot of stuff together! <br />
